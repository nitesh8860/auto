A project to automatically scrape elements from a webpage and create Page Object Model file for that webpage which is to be used with Java Selenium projects.

I'm no more active on this project, as i am not in touch with java selenium anymore, i mostly code in python now.
If anyone is interested in this idea or codebase, please feel free to fork and take it ahead.
